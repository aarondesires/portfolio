#### Welcome to my portfolio! I store my most important pieces and files here to show my dedication into my interests. I hope you enjoy my humble portfolio!

This repository was created after Replit decided to make their website paid. I will be moving all of my files to this repository. To run the files, I recommend using a decompiler or websites such as Replit.

Accounts (You will find MOST of my projects here; I use a decompiler named Eclipse for all my Java files):
